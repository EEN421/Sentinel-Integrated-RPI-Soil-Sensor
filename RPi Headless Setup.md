After burning your SD card with Raspbian OS, you can configure it to automagically join the network and enable SSH with the following steps: 

- Unplug/plug back in your SD card after initial burn
- Navigate to storage
- Create blank file (no extension) named "SSH" (this file is detected and deleted on boot, and SSH is enabled)
- Copy and paste the WPA_supplicant.conf file containing your wireless SSID and Key
- Boot up and wait for it to appear on your network and be available over SSH
