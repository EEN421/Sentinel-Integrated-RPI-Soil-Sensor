After burning your SD card with Raspbian OS, you can configure it to automagically join the network and enable SSH with the following steps: 

- 1. Unplug/plug back in your SD card after initial burn
- 2. Navigate to storage
- 3. Create blank file (no extension) named "SSH" (this file is detected and deleted on boot, and SSH is enabled)
- 4. Copy and paste the [WPA_supplicant.conf](https://github.com/EEN421/Sentinel-Integrated-RPI-Soil-Sensor/blob/Main/wpa_supplicant.conf) file containing your wireless SSID and Key 
- 5. Boot up and wait for it to appear on your network and be available over SSH
