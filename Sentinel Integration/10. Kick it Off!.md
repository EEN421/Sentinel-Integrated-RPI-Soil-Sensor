 > &#128161;[Pro-Tip]&#128161; Create a bash file to launch FluentD with the appropriate parameters so you don't have to type it out every time:
```
sudo nano Start_FluentD.bash
```
Paste the following into nano, save and close: 
```python
sudo fluentd -c /etc/fluent.conf --log /var/log/td-agent/fluent.log &
```
&#128073; Now you can start FluentD with the following command:
```python
sudo bash Start_FluentD.bash &
```
